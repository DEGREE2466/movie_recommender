# Pre_portfolio #

This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT files for the Pre-Portfolio project

The HTML file contains simple HTML codes same as the CSS, but the Javascript file has comments that give info on what most of the codes do.

This is a project done by Ndefo Afam and Uzochukwu Godwin in partial fulfillment of our ALX software engineering program.  

The project is about a movie recommender website that suggests movies to users based on similar genres. It does this when the user searches for the movie in the search box, and the recommender pops up movies in the same genre. 

We used HMTL to write the basic layout of the website landing page and used CSS to style it.
